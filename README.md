Simulations of the gas gain of the CHARM detectors

The detector segements have a curved geometry with the anode wires at a radius of 800 mm, however here the segments are modelled as planar with the following geometry.

_______________   Entrance window (y = 16.37 mm)



o o o o o o o o   Cathode wires - diameter = 50 um (y = 3.2 mm)

. . . . . . . .   Anode wires - diameter = 15 um (y = 1.6 mm)

---------------   Cathode stripes (y = 0)


The entrance window has negative high voltage applied and the anode wires have positive high voltage. The cathode wires and stripes are grounded.


Each of the CHARM detector segments has been tested using an x-ray vessel with a 55Fe source. An ArCO2 (80:20) gas mixture at atmospheric pressure was flowed over the segments during the tests and the source scanned across the centre of the anode wires. The aim of this simulation is to estimate the magnitude of the gain change expected by small displacements of the wire positions and to compare this to the measured values. Ideally this can be related to an expected gain change using the final gas composition of 6.5 bar 4He + 1.5 bar CF4.
